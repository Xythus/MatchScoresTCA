The Composable Architecture (TCA, for short) is a library for building applications in a consistent 
and understandable way, with composition, testing, and ergonomics in mind. It can be used in 
SwiftUI, UIKit, and more, and on any Apple platform (iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS).

## What is the Composable Architecture?

This library provides a few core tools that can be used to build applications of varying purpose and 
complexity. It provides compelling stories that you can follow to solve many problems you encounter 
day-to-day when building applications, such as:

* **State management**
  <br> How to manage the state of your application using simple value types, and share state across 
  many screens so that mutations in one screen can be immediately observed in another screen.

* **Composition**
  <br> How to break down large features into smaller components that can be extracted to their own, 
  isolated modules and be easily glued back together to form the feature.

* **Side effects**
  <br> How to let certain parts of the application talk to the outside world in the most testable 
  and understandable way possible.

* **Testing**
  <br> How to not only test a feature built in the architecture, but also write integration tests 
  for features that have been composed of many parts, and write end-to-end tests to understand how 
  side effects influence your application. This allows you to make strong guarantees that your 
  business logic is running in the way you expect.

* **Ergonomics**
  <br> How to accomplish all of the above in a simple API with as few concepts and moving parts as 
  possible.

## Basic Usage

To build a feature using the Composable Architecture you define some types and values that model 
your domain:

* **State**: A type that describes the data your feature needs to perform its logic and render its 
UI.
* **Action**: A type that represents all of the actions that can happen in your feature, such as 
user actions, notifications, event sources and more.
* **Reducer**: A function that describes how to evolve the current state of the app to the next 
state given an action. The reducer is also responsible for returning any effects that should be 
run, such as API requests, which can be done by returning an `Effect` value.
* **Store**: The runtime that actually drives your feature. You send all user actions to the store 
so that the store can run the reducer and effects, and you can observe state changes in the store 
so that you can update UI.

The benefits of doing this are that you will instantly unlock testability of your feature, and you 
will be able to break large, complex features into smaller domains that can be glued together.

As a basic example, consider a UI that shows a number along with "+" and "âˆ’" buttons that increment 
and decrement the number. To make things interesting, suppose there is also a button that when 
tapped makes an API request to fetch a random fact about that number and then displays the fact in 
an alert.

To implement this feature we create a new type that will house the domain and behavior of the 
feature by conforming to `Reducer`:
